<center><b>The Illustrious Silence</b> combines my passions of literature and data visualization into a series of coputer-generated images. The end result is a collection of art pieces that are truly a collaberation between myself and the machine.

## Motivation
  
Stories and literature have always played a special role in my life. It's funny how the feeling that these words give me are not something that I have ever been able to replicate in words of my own. <b>The Illustrious Silence</b> was built to act as an attempt to visually represent my feelings for some of these words, but evolved into what really became a colaberative project between myself and the computer.
