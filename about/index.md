## Current Work
I currently work as the Director of Education at the Toronto-based startup <a href="http://www.hatchcanada.com"><b>Hatch Canada</b></a> which focuses on teaching children aged 7-17 programming. I'm developping self-paced, progressive curriculums to get young people excited about the ability to create with code. Much of what I'm hoping to write here will be based around my experiments in a classroom filled with alternate-learning stratagies.

## Past Work

Previously, I've worked creating art through code. Some of my past projects can be found in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section of this website.
