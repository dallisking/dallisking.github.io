## Current Work
I currently work at the Toronto-based startup <a href="http://www.hatchcanada.com"><b>Hatch Canada</b></a> which focuses on teaching children aged 7-17 programming through a progessive, self-paced curriculum. My work touches on many different aspects of the company. I've built out large-scale recruitement and onboarding procedures, educational theories, classroom-management strategies and training documents. More recently I've begun to work more closely with the product itself. I develop new features for the learning platform, come up with solutions to stress points, and conduct testing and surveys to ensure that every person using the platform feels comfortable and wildly creative. 

## Past Work
Previously, I've designed and created computational art. Some of my past projects can be found in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section of this website.
